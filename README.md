# Linear Algebra Library

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/1f817ce85f8e4dda9941c9f34d3c2892)](https://app.codacy.com/manual/ShaanCoding/Linear-Algebra-Library?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=ShaanCoding/Linear-Algebra-Library&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

This application is my first program created in java as to aid me in my course of "Linear Dynamical Systems" as well as "Programming 1" by having the requirement to brush up on linear algebra and the requirement to learn java, I decided to instead to combine the two into one simple yet complicated text based project. Note: This project is a near identical port of the linear algebra library created in my previous project Sectrics.
